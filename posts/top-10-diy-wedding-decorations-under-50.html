                    <p>Decorating your wedding doesn't have to cost a fortune. With a little creativity, some smart planning, and the right supplies, you can create beautiful, memorable décor—without breaking the bank.</p>

                    <p>In this guide, I'm sharing 10 DIY wedding decoration ideas you can do for under $50 each. These ideas are budget-friendly, stylish, and customizable for your theme. Plus, I've included tips on how to make each project as simple and stress-free as possible.</p>

                    <h2>1. Vase and Flower Centerpieces</h2>
                    <p>Simple glass or ceramic vases can be transformed into elegant centerpieces with a few blooms, greenery, or fairy lights. You don't need expensive flowers—faux stems or seasonal blooms work perfectly.</p>

                    <p>You can mix and match different vase shapes and sizes for a layered look that feels intentional. Adding small LED tea lights or string lights inside the vases creates a soft glow, perfect for evening receptions. Group several vases together in clusters for a bigger visual impact without spending a lot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose flowers and greenery that fit your color palette and consider reusing them from ceremony to reception to save money.</p>

                    <h2>2. DIY Table Runners</h2>
                    <p>Instead of renting expensive fabrics, you can make your own table runners from burlap, lace, or inexpensive fabric. These runners can add texture and interest to your tables while staying on budget.</p>

                    <p>You can personalize them by adding a decorative ribbon along the edge, a glittery stencil design, or even hand-painting initials or motifs to match your wedding theme. This small DIY project can elevate the look of plain tables without much cost.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Fabric glue or double-sided tape can help keep decorations in place without sewing.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for burlap rolls, lace fabric, or fabric paint -->

                    <h2>3. Paper Flower Garlands</h2>
                    <p>Paper flowers are surprisingly elegant and can be customized to match any color scheme. Make garlands for your ceremony arch, reception backdrop, or photo booth area.</p>

                    <p>Using double-sided cardstock ensures your flowers have depth and durability. Mix sizes and layers to make the garland feel lush, and string it along twine or ribbon for an easy hanging solution. This is a lightweight option, so you can hang multiple garlands without worrying about extra weight or stability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Pick colors that complement your wedding palette and add a few metallic accents for a more polished look.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for cardstock, floral wire, or garland string -->

                    <h2>4. LED Candles</h2>
                    <p>Candles instantly create ambiance, but real candles can be risky and expensive. LED candles give the same warm glow without the fire hazard.</p>

                    <p>Place them inside glass holders, lanterns, or even decorative bowls for a soft, romantic light. You can scatter them along the aisle, line tables, or float them in water for a more dramatic effect. The best part? LED candles are reusable for future events, which makes them a smart investment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use different heights and sizes to add dimension and visual interest to your tables.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for LED candles, glass holders, or lanterns -->

                    <h2>5. Photo Clip Strings</h2>
                    <p>Display your favorite memories with a simple photo clip string. Clip printed photos, notes, or table numbers along twine or string lights. It's a charming way to personalize your wedding space.</p>

                    <p>This DIY decoration works well for both the ceremony and reception. You can hang them across a wall, above a dessert table, or around the guestbook station. It's inexpensive, interactive, and gives your guests something to enjoy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Mix in small greenery sprigs or faux flowers for a polished, cohesive look.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for string lights, clips, or mini clothespins -->

                    <h2>6. DIY Signage</h2>
                    <p>Signs are practical and decorative. Use wooden boards, chalkboards, or acrylic sheets with painted or vinyl lettering. You can create welcome signs, directional signs, menus, or playful messages for guests.</p>

                    <p>Personalized signs add a professional touch without a professional price tag. They can also be repurposed for photo opportunities, like a welcome sign at the entrance or a sign guiding guests to your photo booth.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a ruler and painter's tape to create clean lines and spacing for lettering if painting by hand.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for wooden signs, chalk markers, or vinyl lettering kits -->

                    <h2>7. Fabric or Paper Lanterns</h2>
                    <p>Lanterns are a great way to add dimension and atmosphere to your wedding space. Hang them from ceilings, trees, or use them as part of a table centerpiece.</p>

                    <p>Paper or fabric lanterns come in many sizes and colors, so you can mix and match to complement your wedding theme. They're lightweight, easy to hang, and create a whimsical, airy feel without a huge price tag.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Add small LED inserts inside paper lanterns for a soft glow. Arrange them in clusters for maximum impact.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for paper lanterns, LED inserts, or hanging hooks -->

                    <h2>8. Ribbon or Tulle Chair Décor</h2>
                    <p>Plain chairs don't have to stay plain. Adding ribbons, tulle, or fabric sashes transforms them instantly.</p>

                    <p>You can tie a simple bow, drape tulle across the back, or even weave ribbon with small floral accents. This small detail elevates the look of your ceremony or reception space without spending much. Plus, tulle and ribbons are inexpensive, reusable, and come in many colors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure bows and drapes are secure but easy to remove, so chairs are ready for guests quickly.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for tulle rolls, ribbon sets, or chair clips -->

                    <h2>9. Mini Potted Plants or Succulents</h2>
                    <p>Mini potted plants or succulents are both décor and favors in one. Place them on tables, line aisles, or give them to guests as a keepsake.</p>

                    <p>Succulents are durable, low-maintenance, and can be dressed up with small tags or ribbons to match your theme. This is a practical, eco-friendly way to incorporate greenery into your wedding while staying under budget.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use uniform pots for a polished look, or mix different textures and sizes for a more natural, relaxed feel.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for mini succulents, pots, or plant tags -->

                    <h2>10. DIY Candle or Flower Centerpiece Trays</h2>
                    <p>For a simple yet elegant centerpiece, arrange candles, flowers, and small decorative elements on a tray or shallow dish.</p>

                    <p>This is especially effective for long tables or buffet-style setups. Use varying candle heights or stack small items to add dimension. This approach allows you to use fewer materials while still creating a centerpiece that feels full and intentional.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Mix in seasonal greenery, faux blooms, or small lanterns for added style without exceeding your budget.</p>

                    <!-- TODO: add Amazon product link for trays, candle holders, or faux flowers -->

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
